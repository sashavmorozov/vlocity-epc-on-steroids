# EPC on Steroids

## Overview
The EPC on Steroids is a "smart" Google spreadsheet that can dramatically improve the ways how you document, implement and operate catalog-driven solutions with Vlocity Product Caralog. 

The EPC on Steroids includes two key elements:
* a project-agnostic template for detailed (low-level) product catalog design
* a set of capabilities to convert the design into Vlocity terms and push it to a target Salesforce org

A typical process to configure a new offering (or another artifact) is illustrated below. Simply put, a catalog designer defines catalog configuration design in a spreadsheet (with copy-paste, formulas and other great things coming from the Excel) and then pushes a button to apply the changes to a Salesforce organization. Quickly, precisely and without hundreds of clicks. 

Collaboration and versioning capabilities are backed by Google Spreadsheets engine.
